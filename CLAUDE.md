# Development Guidelines

## Code Quality Standards

### General Principles
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow SOLID principles and established design patterns
- Keep functions/methods small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use meaningful and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- Avoid code duplication (DRY principle)

### Code Style
- Use consistent indentation and formatting
- Add comments for complex logic, but prefer self-documenting code
- Keep lines reasonably short (typically 80-120 characters)
- Group related code together and separate concerns

### Error Handling
- Always handle errors appropriately
- Use specific error types rather than generic ones
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Fail fast and fail loudly during development

## Testing Requirements

### Test Coverage
- Aim for high test coverage (80%+ for critical code paths)
- Write tests before or alongside implementation (TDD when appropriate)
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions
- Include both positive and negative test cases

### Test Quality
- Use descriptive test names that explain the scenario
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert (AAA) pattern
- Keep tests isolated and independent
- Mock external dependencies
- Ensure tests run quickly and reliably

## Security Best Practices

### Input Validation
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Escape output to prevent XSS attacks
- Implement proper CSRF protection

### Authentication & Authorization
- Use established authentication libraries/frameworks
- Store passwords securely using proper hashing (bcrypt, argon2)
- Implement proper session management
- Apply the principle of least privilege
- Validate authorization on every protected endpoint

### Sensitive Data
- Never hardcode credentials, API keys, or secrets
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Be careful with logging sensitive information
- Implement proper encryption for data at rest and in transit

## Performance Considerations

- Optimize database queries and use appropriate indexes
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Avoid N+1 query problems
- Use lazy loading and pagination for large datasets
- Profile code to identify bottlenecks before optimizing

## Documentation

- Document public APIs and interfaces
- Keep documentation up to date with code changes
- Include usage examples in documentation
- Document non-obvious design decisions and tradeoffs
- Maintain a clear README with setup instructions

## Version Control

- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Use feature branches for new development
- Review code before merging
- Keep the main branch stable and deployable

## Code Review Guidelines

When reviewing code, check for:
- Correctness and functionality
- Code quality and readability
- Test coverage and quality
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance implications
- Documentation completeness

## Continuous Improvement

- Regularly refactor to reduce technical debt
- Stay updated with best practices and new technologies
- Learn from mistakes and incidents
- Share knowledge with the team
- Be open to feedback and suggestions
