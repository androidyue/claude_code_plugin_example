Generate a well-structured commit message for the current changes. Analyze the git diff and create a commit message that follows best practices.

## Commit Message Guidelines

1. **Format**
   - First line: Brief summary (50 chars or less)
   - Blank line
   - Detailed description explaining what and why (wrap at 72 chars)
   - Focus on the motivation and context, not just what changed

2. **Content Requirements**
   - Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - Be specific and descriptive
   - Explain the reasoning behind changes
   - Mention any breaking changes or important notes
   - Group related changes logically

3. **Structure**
   - Start with the type: feat, fix, refactor, docs, test, chore, style, perf
   - Provide context about the problem being solved
   - Explain the solution approach if non-obvious
   - List key changes in bullet points for complex commits

4. **Important Restrictions**
   - Do NOT include any AI assistant names or references
   - Do NOT include tool attribution
   - Do NOT add co-author tags for AI assistants
   - Keep the message focused on the code changes only

5. **Quality Checks**
   - Is the message clear to someone unfamiliar with the change?
   - Does it explain both WHAT and WHY?
   - Would this be helpful when reviewing git history later?
   - Is it concise but complete?

Generate a commit message that is professional, clear, and follows these guidelines strictly.
