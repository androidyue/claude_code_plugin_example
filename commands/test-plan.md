Create a comprehensive test plan for the specified feature or code. Include:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - List all functions/methods that need unit tests
   - Identify edge cases and boundary conditions
   - Suggest mock requirements

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Identify integration points
   - Define test scenarios for component interactions
   - Database/API integration test cases

3. **End-to-End Tests**
   - User workflow scenarios
   - Critical path testing
   - Error handling flows

4. **Test Data Requirements**
   - Sample data needed
   - Test fixtures setup
   - Database seeding requirements

5. **Expected Outcomes**
   - Success criteria for each test
   - Expected vs actual results format

Format the output as actionable test cases that can be implemented immediately.
